# Decisions Log

## Decision 001

**Title:** The product is not a CRM
**Status:** Final
**Why:** Scope protection. The product focuses on advisor enablement through eligibility and comparison, not application tracking or document workflows.

---

## Decision 002

**Title:** Core v1 scope
**Status:** Final
**Decision:** v1 focuses on:

1. Direct evaluation
2. General comparison
3. Admin configuration

---

## Decision 003

**Title:** Arabic-first product
**Status:** Final
**Decision:** The full v1 user experience is Arabic-first, including advisor-facing UI and admin-facing UI.

---

## Decision 004

**Title:** program and program_offering are separate entities
**Status:** Final
**Why:** One academic program can have multiple operational offerings with different intakes, fees, campuses, or availability.

---

## Decision 005

**Title:** British qualification requires subject-based modeling
**Status:** Final
**Why:** British profiles cannot be handled safely as generic key/value-only answers.

---

## Decision 006

**Title:** Business logic must not live in UI
**Status:** Final
**Why:** Prevents duplication, hidden behavior, and architectural drift.

---

## Decision 007

**Title:** Rule engine direction
**Status:** Final
**Decision:** Use typed rule registry architecture, not hardcoded columns and not uncontrolled JSON.

---

## Decision 008

**Title:** Rule severity location
**Status:** Final
**Decision:** In v1.1, severity is defined at the rule group level, not per rule.

---

## Decision 009

**Title:** No-rules behavior
**Status:** Final
**Decision:** Unsupported offering + qualification contexts should be hidden in UI where possible, and runtime must return `needs_review`.

---

## Decision 010

**Title:** Normalization ownership
**Status:** Final
**Decision:** Normalization happens in backend/service normalization layer, not in UI.

---

## Decision 011

**Title:** Data errors are not automatically engine errors
**Status:** Final
**Decision:** The system must distinguish between engine bugs, rule modeling errors, data entry errors, and import/transformation errors.

---

## Decision 012

**Title:** Platform library + tenant overlay
**Status:** Final
**Decision:** The platform owns the core library. Organizations activate and optionally override what they use.

---

## Decision 013

**Title:** Versioning for rules
**Status:** Final
**Decision:** Rules must support draft/published/archived lifecycle through versioned rule sets.

---

## Decision 014

**Title:** Import pipeline is not phase 1
**Status:** Final
**Decision:** Core schema comes first. Import/staging/publish comes after core schema is stable.

---

## Decision 015

**Title:** Migration 1 accepted after local runtime validation
**Status:** Final
**Decision:** Migration 1 core schema (30 tables, 17 enums, 26 indexes) was validated by applying it against a live Supabase PostgreSQL instance via `supabase db reset`. It is now the accepted baseline schema.

---

## Decision 016

**Title:** qualification_types uniqueness uses partial unique indexes
**Status:** Final
**Decision:** A single composite unique constraint cannot enforce key uniqueness for platform-owned rows because PostgreSQL treats NULLs as distinct. Two partial unique indexes are used: one for platform-owned rows (`UNIQUE (key) WHERE owner_scope = 'platform'`) and one for organization-owned rows (`UNIQUE (owner_organization_id, key) WHERE owner_scope = 'organization'`).

---

## Decision 017

**Title:** Supabase CLI is the standard local migration workflow
**Status:** Final
**Decision:** The project uses Supabase CLI for migration management and local development. Migrations live in `supabase/migrations/`. Local validation uses `supabase db reset`.
